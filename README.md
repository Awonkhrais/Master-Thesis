# Master-Thesis

The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Twitter's hate speech categorization system for corporate image management. The focus was on automating the identification of hate speech to enhance strategies for managing corporate image. Two machine learning models were developed to achieve this objective. The findings of this research indicate that hate speech on the internet can indeed be automatically recognized, offering potential opportunities for improved corporate image management practices.
The primary contribution of this thesis lies in the development of two models for hate speech and offensive language classification, resulting in the categorization of content into three levels: poor, moderate, and dangerous. Based on this classification, suggested actions
were assigned for moderators to appropriately address the identified hate speech entries. This approach provides a practical framework for companies to manage and mitigate the impact of hate speech on their corporate image.
Moving forward, there are several practical implications stemming from this research. Firstly, Twitter can leverage the developed hate speech detection models to proactively identify and respond to potential threats to the corporate image of firms using Twitter, so by implementing these models, Twitter can improve the corporate image of the firms on its platform. By categorizing hate speech into different levels, moderators can implement targeted actions to mitigate the risks associated with each category, thereby safeguarding the company's reputation.
However, there are certain limitations to acknowledge. One limitation is the lack of an existing lexicon for hate speech and offensive language classification, requiring the creation of a custom word list. Additionally, online policies and restrictions may impede access to certain words or phrases, affecting the comprehensiveness of the classification process.
Future research endeavors should focus on expanding hate speech detection beyond textual content to encompass other media formats such as images, videos, and voices. By incorporating these elements, a more comprehensive understanding of hate speech on social media platforms can be achieved. Additionally, exploring the development of a broader lexicon or utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques could further improve the accuracy and effectiveness of hate speech classification.
Summarizing, this study contributes to the field of corporate image management by demonstrating the feasibility of automating the identification and categorization of hate speech on Twitter. By employing the developed hate speech detection models and implementing appropriate moderator actions, Twitter, as a platform, can enhance its corporate image by applying the tools to detect and address hate speech. Further research in this area has the potential to advance hate speech detection methods and broaden the scope of analysis to encompass various media types, leading to more comprehensive and effective strategies for corporate image management.
